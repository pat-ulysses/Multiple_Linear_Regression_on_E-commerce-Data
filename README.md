# Multiple Linear Regression on E-commerce Data

This repository contains a project for the **Machine Learning with Python** module, where I implement and evaluate a **Multiple Linear Regression** model on a synthetic E-commerce dataset.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict **Yearly Amount Spent** by customers based on various features such as:
- Time spent on the website
- Time spent on the app
- Length of membership
- Average session length

The project includes:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Model training using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluation using metrics like MSE and R² score

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 File Structure

- `Multiple Linear Regression - E-commerce Data.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing code and analysis
- `Ecommerce Customers.csv`: Dataset used for model training and testing
